# RayTracing
My repo for the ray tracing in a weekend project.

The book is quite short and very interesting.
It gave me a primer on ray tracing and how items are rendered.
It only covers the basics. But builds everything from scratch.
Without any external libraries you are able to create a full 3d world.
It is also good for improving C++ knowledge.

The book can be found here:

Behold my creation :)
